Three very common operations are great to be eliminated:
1) lvl - 1 subtraction
2) references to array[expression]
3) redundant BOUNDS_CHECKs

In order to do that we perform PRE and then BOUNDS_CHECK elimination.


	 * We care only about a certain subset of expressions:
	 *   add_i -1
	 *   getfield_a (?) - this.root
	 *   getfield_i - this.maxLevel for example
	 *   aload_i (quick) and aload_a (skip) (?)
